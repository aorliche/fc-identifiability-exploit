We provide the OpenNeuro dataset ds004144 of 33 female Fibromyalgia patients and 33 female healthy controls.

Due to NIH/UKB data policy, we are not able to provide UKB, PNC, or BSNIP data. If you are an approved researcher or have any questions, please contact us using my email at the bottom.

## Installation
You need to install Jupyter Notebook and some python dependencies. You can do so by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You may need to add ```--break-system-packages``` to the command above or run in a virtual python environment.

## Reproduction on Fibromyalgia
Open Jupyter Notebook in the notebooks directory. Run all cells to reproduce Fibromyalgia dataset results. For example, run the commands:

```
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook
```

Load the Ident4Fibromyalgia notebook and execute each of the cells in order.
